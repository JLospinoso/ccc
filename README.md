# Build the Examples

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/jlospinoso/ccc/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/jlospinoso/ccc)

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:JLospinoso/ccc
```

Next, perform an [out-of-source CMake build](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/home). For example:

```
cd ccc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Your build directory should now contain requisite files for building on your current platform. On Windows, for example, you should find a `.sln` Visual Studio Solution file. On macOS/Linux, you should find a `make` file.
